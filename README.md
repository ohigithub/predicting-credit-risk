# Predicting Credit Risk

## Objective
LendingClub is a peer-to-peer lending services company that allows individual investors to partially fund personal loans as well as buy and sell notes backing the loans on a secondary market. LendingClub offers their previous data through an API. I used their 2019 data to create machine learning models to classify the risk level of given loans for 2020.

## Preprossessing & Models Considered
To interpret the data, I used a logistic regression and a random forests classifier model.
